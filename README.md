# Simple-calendar-application

## Description

In this challenge, I created simple calendar application which allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The goal of this project is to create a daily planner that allows users manage time effectively.

## Installation

This application was accomplished with technologies such as Javascript, JQuery, Day.js, HTML & CSS. No necessary installations needed, just click the deployed link below to utilize.


## Usage
User is able to utilize using the daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN the planner is open, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
WHEN user scrolls down, timeblocks are displayed for standard business hours and shows timeblocks for that day.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN a timeblock is clicked, user can enter an event. User is also able to click the save button for that timeblock and the text for that event is saved in local storage. When user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.


Below, are screenshots of how my web application currently looks like:
